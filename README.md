# Client / Background
A commercial real estate company wants to capitalize on the growing trend of Matcha by way of creating a brand of high end matcha cafes. 
In 2019 the North America Matcha market share was valued at approximately $750 million USD. The industry is expected to gain 7.5% by 2026. 
To be able to meet the expenses and profit expectations, Axem believes it needs to develop cafes in high wealth geographies. (Customers need to be able to afford a premium priced matcha drink. Initially sketched projections have outlined the price points at $8-$10 per drink.)
Thereâ€™s considerable science linking Matcha to potential health benefits. https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/ss/slideshow-all-about-matcha.  https://www.forbes.com/health/body/matcha-tea-health-benefits/
